          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <h3>My academic interests</h3>
          <p>
            My academic interests involve Physical interactions, Affective computing, Ubiquitous computing, and Somaesthetics and the body in HCI. Sustainability and ethics are hugely important to me, both of which are aspects I find sometimes get put on the back burner especially in HCI. <br>
            My dream occupation allows me to improve the lives of others through creative and ethical innovations in HCI.

          <h3>My strengths</h3>
          <p>
            The traits what I value the most in myself are my compassion, intelligence, and sense of humor. Even though I have the capacity to stay professional, I find that humor is a great way to nourish creativity, and I tend to not take myself or life too seriously. I am a creative, kind, and open-minded person who works great both in groups and on my own. I thrives from structure, which is why I never go far without my trusty planner.
            During my studies I have found out I am somewhat of a mean, lean typing machine, as I have received many comments on how quickly I can parse loose findings or open discussions into quality written reports. A strange compliment perhaps, but I take it to heart nonetheless.

          <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
          <p>
            In my spare time I do handcrafts such as sewing and crocheting, tend to my houseplants, and sift through second hand stores in search for interesting items. I like to stay active and spend time in nature, so I lift weights, attend dance classes, and go on long walks in my spare time. 
            In 10 years I see myself sharing my beautiful 1970's house with a large greenhouse with several dogs.
