          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            The traits what I value the most in myself are compassion, intelligence, and a sense of humor. 
            These work in my favour during group projects, and I have found myself to have a great ability to assume the role a group needs.
            While staying professional is important, I find that humor is a great way to nourish creativity and team bonding.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a proud Jill of all trades I love to learn, so during my university studies I took the opportunity to take as many varied courses as I could. 
            During my studies I also found out I am somewhat of a mean, lean typing machine, as I have received many comments on how quickly I can parse open discussions into coherent written text 
            (A strange compliment perhaps, but I take it to heart...). I thrive off of structure, and you will rarely find me without my weekly planner by my side. 
          </p>

          <h3>My professional/academic interests</h3>
          <p>
            My interests revolve around Human-Computer Interactions, especially Physical interactions. 
            Sustainability and ethics are important topics to me, and my dream occupation would allow me to improve the lives of others through creative and ethical innovations in HCI.
          </p>

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            In my spare time I do handcrafts such as sewing and crocheting, tend to my houseplants, and sift through second hand stores. 
            I like to stay active and spend time in nature, so I lift weights, attend dance classes, and go on long walks. I love pets and look forward to having them in the future.
          </p>

          <p>            
            In my teens I volunteered for many conventions for east asian pop-culture. This involved positions such as website translator, head of cleaning crew, café businesses, and ticket sales. 
            I also took part in arranging a convention in my hometown, which we grew from 80 attendees to over 250 in three years.
            This involved writing applications for fundings and grants, booking premises and bands, accomodating for guest speakers, logo designing, promotional visits to other conventions, ordering merch, handling the 
            economics, and much much more. Apart from being a lot of fun, it taught me much about organization and planning.

          <h3>The KTH Electrum Library</h3>
          <p>
            Besides my studies I have worked in the KTH Electrum library as a student librarian secretary for many years. 
            It is a job which requires the ability to find information independently, solve problems in many different areas, be approachable to patrons, and memorize how to use systems.
          </p>
        
          <h3>Customer support and platform assistant at SJ</h3>
            <p>            
              I worked in the ticket sales and customer information for the railway company SJ in the Stockholm Central Station. 
              What started as a summer employment resumed as a part-time job, and I stayed for over a year.
              The job consisted of many different tasks, requiring the ability to take responsibility, think fast, and be prepared for anything. 
              Work tasks included manning info desks and cashiers, handling payments, managing delays and reimburshments, and providing information to travelers in and around the station. 
              I got to practice a lot how to communicate with customers and how to handle emergencies gracefully.
            </p>

          <h3>Teaching assistant KTH</h3>
            <p>            
              I worked as a teachers assistant for the course Human Perception for Information Technology in the autumn of 2021. 
              I graded assignments and assisted with the final presentation event of the course. 
            </p>

          <h3>Student Chapter</h3>
          <p>
            During my time at KTH I have been very active in the student chapter IN-Sektionen. Some of the positions I have held are:
          </p>
          <div class="studentChapter">
            <ul>
              <li>Head of the Business Committee</li>
              <li>Board member with responsibility for JML/Equality work</li>
              <li>Treasurer of Student Pub Association TMEIT</li>

              <li>Boardmember of the organization group of the yearly Reception, held to welcome new students for the autumn semester.</li>
              <li>Head organizer of an improv acting group in the Reception</li>
              <li>Protection Agent for the Chapter</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

            <p>
              These roles have all provided me with experience in project organization, group communication and planning, and staying structured.
