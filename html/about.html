          <h3>Who is Celine?</h3>
          <h4>The Team Player</h4>
          <p>
            The traits what I value the most in myself are my compassion, intelligence, and sense of humor, all of which make most group projects a breeze. 
            The last few years of my university studies were basically 90% group projects, and I have found myself to have a great ability to assume the role the group needs, whether that be a leader, an organizor, or the comic relief.
            While staying professional is of outmost importance, I find that humor is a great way to nourish creativity and team bonding.
          </p>
          <h4>The Jill of all Trades</h4>
          <p>
            I love to learn, and spend a lot of my free time watching documentaries or learning new crafts (latest one being knitting). 
            During my university studies I took the opportunity to take as many varied courses as I could. 
            I soak up new knowledge like a sponge, and as a result, I tend to know a little bit about a lot.
          </p>
          <h4>The Scheduling Scribe</h4>
          <p>
            During my studies I have found out I am somewhat of a mean, lean typing machine, as I have received many comments on how quickly I can parse loose arguments or open discussions into coherent, high-quality written texts. 
            (A strange compliment perhaps, but I take it to heart nonetheless) I thrive off of structure, and you will rarely find me without my trusty weekly planner by my side. 
          </p>

          <h3>My academic interests</h3>
          <p>
            My academic interests involve Physical interactions, Affective computing, Ubiquitous computing, and Somaesthetics and the body in HCI. 
            Sustainability and ethics are hugely important to me, both of which are aspects I find sometimes get put on the back burner especially in HCI. <br>
            My dream occupation allows me to improve the lives of others through creative and ethical innovations in HCI.

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            In my spare time I do handcrafts such as sewing and crocheting, tend to my houseplants, and sift through second hand stores in search for interesting stuff. 
            I like to stay active and spend time in nature, so I lift weights, attend dance classes, and go on long walks to clear my mind. 
            In 10 years I see myself sharing a beautiful 1970's house with a large conservatory with several dogs.

          <h3>The KTH Electrum Library</h3>
          <p>
            I have worked in the KTH Electrum library as a student librarian secretary for many years as a part time employment besides my studies. 
            It is a job which requires the ability to find information independently, solve problems in many different areas, be approachable to patrons, and memorize how to use systems.
            It also allowed me to really do a deep-dive into the abundance of academic literature available.

          <h3>Customer support and platform assistant at SJ</h3>

            <p>            
              I worked in the ticket sales and customer information for the railway company SJ in their store in the Stockholm Central Station. 
              What started as a summer employment became a part-time job as summer ended, and I stayed until the pandemic hit.
              The job consisted of many different tasks, requiring the ability to take responsibility, think fast, and be prepared for anything. 
              Work tasks included manning info desks and cashiers, handling payments, managing delays and reimburshments, and providing information to travelers in the station. 
              I got to practice a lot how to communicate with customers and how to handle emergencies gracefully.

          <h3>Teacher assistant KTH</h3>

            <p>            
              Duration:
              I worked as a teachers assistant for the course Human Perception for Information Technology in the autumn of 2021. 
              My task was to grade assignments and assist with the final presentation event of the course. The employment lasted only over through one course, but reading the students' essays made for a fun employment!

          <h3>Student Chapter</h3>
          <p>
            During my time at KTH I have been very active in the student chapter IN-Sektionen. Some of the positions I have held are:

          <h3>Conventions</h3>

            <p>            
              In my teens I volunteered for many conventions for east asian pop-culture. 
              This involved positions such as website translator, head of cleaning crew, café businesses, and ticket sales. <br>
              I also arranged a convention with a group of local teenagers in my hometown, which we grew from 80 attendees to over 250 in three years.
              The organizational work required applications for fundings and grants, booking premises, booking bands, inviting and accomodating for guest speakers from all over the world, logotype designing, promotional visits to other conventions, ordering merchendise, handling the 
              economics, holding meetings, and much much more. Apart from being a fun activity to partake in, it taught me much in terms of organization and planning. I developed skills in problem solving and thinking on my feet, overcoming obstacles, and communicating with other organizers, attendees, and invited guests.

          <h3>Earlier life</h3>

          <p>
            I attended Ehrensvärdska Gymnasiet in Karlskrona at the program for natural sciences called "Naturvetenskapsprogrammet NANATOS spetsutbildning i matematik Leonardo", a program with special focus on mathematics.
            This allowed me to attend several university courses in mathematics at Blekinge Tekniska Högskola BTH.
