          <h3>Who is Celine?</h3>
          <h4>The Team Player</h4>
          <p>
            The traits what I value the most in myself are my compassion, intelligence, and sense of humor, all of which make most group projects a breeze. 
            The last few years of my university studies were basically 90% group projects, and I have found myself to have a great ability to assume the role the group needs, whether that be a leader, an organizor, or the comic relief.
            While staying professional is of outmost importance, I find that humor is a great way to nourish creativity and team bonding.
          </p>
          <h4>The Jill of all Trades</h4>
          <p>
            I love to learn, and spend a lot of my free time watching documentaries or learning new crafts (latest one being knitting). 
            During my university studies I took the opportunity to take as many varied courses as I could. 
            I soak up new knowledge like a sponge, and as a result, I tend to know a little bit about a lot.
          </p>
          <h4>The Scheduling Scribe</h4>
          <p>
            During my studies I have found out I am somewhat of a mean, lean typing machine, as I have received many comments on how quickly I can parse loose arguments or open discussions into coherent, high-quality written texts. 
            (A strange compliment perhaps, but I take it to heart nonetheless) I thrive off of structure, and you will rarely find me without my trusty weekly planner by my side.

          <h3>My academic interests</h3>
          <p>
            My academic interests involve Physical interactions, Affective computing, Ubiquitous computing, and Somaesthetics and the body in HCI. 
            Sustainability and ethics are hugely important to me, both of which are aspects I find sometimes get put on the back burner especially in HCI. <br>
            My dream occupation allows me to improve the lives of others through creative and ethical innovations in HCI.

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            In my spare time I do handcrafts such as sewing and crocheting, tend to my houseplants, and sift through second hand stores in search for interesting stuff. 
            I like to stay active and spend time in nature, so I lift weights, attend dance classes, and go on long walks to clear my mind. 
            In 10 years I see myself sharing a beautiful 1970's house with a large conservatory with several dogs.

          <h3>The KTH Electrum Library</h3>
          <p>
            I have worked in the KTH Electrum library as a student librarian secretary for many years as a part time employment besides my studies. 
            It is a job which requires the ability to find information independently, solve problems in many different areas, be approachable to patrons, and memorize how to use systems.
            It also allowed me to really do a deep-dive into the abundance of academic literature available.

          <h3>Customer support and platform assistant at SJ</h3>

            <p>            
              I worked in the ticket sales and customer information for the railway company SJ in their store in the Stockholm Central Station. 
              What started as a summer employment became a part-time job as summer ended, and I stayed until the pandemic hit.
              The job consisted of many different tasks, requiring the ability to take responsibility, think fast, and be prepared for anything. 
              Work tasks included manning info desks and cashiers, handling payments, managing delays and reimburshments, and providing information to travelers in the station. 
              I got to practice a lot how to communicate with customers and how to handle emergencies gracefully.

          <h3>Teacher assistant KTH</h3>

            <p>            
              Duration:
              I worked as a teachers assistant for the course Human Perception for Information Technology in the autumn of 2021. 
              My task was to grade assignments and assist with the final presentation event of the course. The employment lasted only over through one course, but reading the students' essays made for a fun employment!
