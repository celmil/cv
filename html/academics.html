          <h3>Master's Degree KTH</h3>
          <p>
            Masters degree in Interactive Media Technology, where I attended the Physical Interaction track. My thesis will be finished in the summer of 2022. 
            
            A selection of some of the courses and projects I have done during my time at my master's programme:

            As our project in the course Physical Interaction Design and Realization, we created BubblePlay, a device which produces bubbles by spinning a pole.
            The device used 3D printed gears for the bubble machine and an Arduino board for controlling the lights.

            In the course Advanced Projectcourse in Interactive Media Technology, we developed the "Move it Move it Microwave", a dance-controlled microwave designed to encourage playful interactions in the kitchen environment. 
            The device used an Arduino board and motion detection software to control the switch in the microwave, producing a microwave which only worked when you danced in front of it. In addition, it plays a musical beat if more than one person participates, which invites for social interactions.

              Bachelor degree in IT engineering at The Royal Institute of Technology KTH. I finished my thesis in 2020.
              The thesis work produced a tool for comparison of Application development tools based on UX.

          <h3>Earlier life</h3>

          <p>
            I attended Ehrensvärdska Gymnasiet in Karlskrona at the program for natural sciences called "Naturvetenskapsprogrammet NANATOS spetsutbildning i matematik Leonardo", a program with special focus on mathematics.
            This allowed me to attend several university courses in mathematics at Blekinge Tekniska Högskola BTH.
