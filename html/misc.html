          <h3>Student Chapter</h3>
          <p>
            During my time at KTH I have been very active in the student chapter IN-Sektionen. Some of the positions I have held are:
          </p>
            <ul>

              <li>Head organizer of an improv acting group in the Reception</li>

              These roles have all provided me with ample experience in project organization, group communication and planning, and staying structured.

          <h3>Conventions</h3>

            <p>            
              In my teens I volunteered for many conventions for east asian pop-culture. 
              This involved positions such as website translator, head of cleaning crew, café businesses, and ticket sales. <br>
              I also arranged a convention with a group of local teenagers in my hometown, which we grew from 80 attendees to over 250 in three years.
              The organizational work required applications for fundings and grants, booking premises, booking bands, inviting and accomodating for guest speakers from all over the world, logotype designing, promotional visits to other conventions, ordering merchendise, handling the 
              economics, holding meetings, and much much more. Apart from being a fun activity to partake in, it taught me much in terms of organization and planning. I developed skills in problem solving and thinking on my feet, overcoming obstacles, and communicating with other organizers, attendees, and invited guests.
