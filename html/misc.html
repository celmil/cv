          <h3>Conventions</h3>

            <p>            
              In my teens I volunteered for, and organized, conventions for east asian pop-culture. 
              This involved positions such as website translator, head of cleaning crew, head of security and sleeping accomodations, and many others. 
              The organizational work required applications for funding, booking premises, bands, and guest speakers, logotype designing, ordering merchendise, handling the 
              economics, and holding meetings.
