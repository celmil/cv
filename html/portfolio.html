              On this page I have gathered a few of the projects I have worked on, mostly from my studies. In the gallery below, you'll find some of the bigger projects such as my BSc and MSc thesis projects.
              Some other examples of my work are <a href="../assets/pdf/haptic_individual.pdf" download>the course project on haptic interactions</a> investingating the possibility of using haptics to convey emotions, 
              <a href="../assets/pdf/hci_loneliness_paper.pdf" download>a paper about the use of HCI technology to reduce loneliness</a>,

                  My Masters thesis in Interactive Media Technology from The Royal Institute of Technology KTH, finished in 2022. 
                  In this thesis I investigated relaxation in physical interactions through the method of Soma Design by exploring ASMR media and the bodily experiences of feeling ASMR. 
                  The design process involved first person material exploration, somaesthetic sensitivity training in the form of meditation, a workshop with another interaction designer, and data analysis in the form of affinity diagrams.

                  My Bachelor thesis in IT engineering at The Royal Institute of Technology KTH, finished in 2020. In this thesis, we produced a tool to aid in the selection of different application technologies. 
                  The tool asks a few questions, and based on the results from usability test studies we ran on native applications and progressive web applications, the tool can recommend which technology is most suitable for the planned application.

                  I prototype for a mobile application developed as a part of an online course in Figma I am currently taking. The application is designed with a sustainabilty-branded fashion company in mind.
                  Apart from the Figma prototype, I have also edited the background pictures and created most of the assets as vectors. 
                  The prototype is still under construction, you can follow the link to see how far I have gotten at the time you are reading!

                  In the course Media Technology and Interaction Design, me and my group decided to design a potential solution to problems with remote working. The design process included e.g. interviews, persona creation, and low-fi prototyping.
                  It led us to the idea of OnBoard, a device that could provide those working from home with a physical representation of the workspace in order to improve feelings of beloning and control. 
                  To view the whole design process, follow <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/129869653/OnBoard" target="_blank">this link to the Behance presentation</a>.

                    WorldPong is a concept/prototype of a mobile game. I created this to introduce myself to Figma based on an original idea for an engaging mobile game. 
                    The concept revolves around a game where you track WorldPongs, pingpong like digital balls which travel around the world. When a ball is closing in on your location, you can use your phone 
                    to whack the ball away, changing its trajectory.

                  As our project in the course Physical Interaction Design and Realization, we created BubblePlay, a device which produces bubbles by spinning a pole.
                  The device used 3D printed gears for the bubble machine and an Arduino board for controlling LED light strips surrounding the device.

                  In the course Advanced Project course in Interactive Media Technology, we developed the "Move it Move it Microwave", a dance-controlled microwave designed to encourage playful interactions in the kitchen environment. 
                  The device used an Arduino board and motion detection software to control the switch in the microwave, producing a microwave which only worked when you danced in front of it. In addition, it plays a musical beat if more than one person participates, which invites for social interactions.
