            <h3>Master's Degree KTH</h3>
            <p>
              Masters degree in Interactive Media Technology, where I attend the Physical Interaction track. My thesis will be finished in the summer of 2022. 
              
              A selection of some of the courses and projects I have done during my time at my master's programme: </br>

              As our project in the course Physical Interaction Design and Realization, we created BubblePlay, a device which produces bubbles by spinning a pole.
              The device used 3D printed gears for the bubble machine and an Arduino board for controlling LED light strips surrounding the device.

            <p>
              In the course Advanced Projectcourse in Interactive Media Technology, we developed the "Move it Move it Microwave", a dance-controlled microwave designed to encourage playful interactions in the kitchen environment. 
              The device used an Arduino board and motion detection software to control the switch in the microwave, producing a microwave which only worked when you danced in front of it. In addition, it plays a musical beat if more than one person participates, which invites for social interactions.

            <h3>Bachelor's Degree KTH</h3>
            
              <p>            
                Bachelor degree in IT engineering at The Royal Institute of Technology KTH. I finished my thesis in 2020.
                The thesis work produced a tool for comparison of Application development tools based on UX.

            <h3>Earlier life</h3>

            <p>
              I attended Ehrensvärdska Gymnasiet in Karlskrona at the program for natural sciences called "Naturvetenskapsprogrammet NANATOS spetsutbildning i matematik Leonardo", a program with special focus on mathematics.
              This allowed me to attend several university courses in mathematics at Blekinge Tekniska Högskola BTH.
