          <h3>The KTH Electrum Library</h3>
          <p>
            Duration:
            I have worked in the KTH Electrum library as a student librarian secretary for many years as a part time employment besides my studies. 
            It is a job which requires the ability to find information independently, solve problems in many different areas, be approachable to patrons, and memorize how to use systems.

            <p>            
              Duration:
              I worked in the store of the railway company SJ in the Central Station in Stockholm. 
              The job consisted of many different tasks, requiring the ability to take responsibility, think fast, and be prepared for anything. 
              Work tasks included manning info desks and cashiers, handling payments, managing delays and reimburshments, and providing information to travelers in the station. I got to practice a lot how to communicate with customers and how to handle emergencies.
