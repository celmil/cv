            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to my website! My name is Celine and I am a fresh graduate from the master's program Interactive Media Technology at The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. 
              This website is where I store my CV and portfolio, and a bit about who I am and what I'm all about!<br>
              I continuously update this website with new info (or just to play around with the code), and you can find the code I wrote for this website in <a href="https://github.com/celmil/cv" target="_blank">this Github repository</a>.
            </p>
          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            The traits what I value the most in myself are compassion, intelligence, and a sense of humor. 
            These work in my favour during group projects, and I have found myself to have a great ability to assume the role a group needs.
            While staying professional is important, I find that humor is a great way to nourish creativity and team bonding.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a proud Jill of all trades I love to learn, so during my university studies I took the opportunity to take as many varied courses as I could. I thrive off of structure, and you will rarely find me without my weekly planner by my side. 
          </p>

          <h3>My professional/academic interests</h3>
          <p>
            My interests revolve around Human-Computer Interactions, especially Physical interactions. 
            Sustainability and ethics are important topics to me, and my dream occupation would allow me to improve the lives of others through creative and ethical innovations in HCI.
          </p>

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            In my spare time I like to do various handcrafts, stay active, and spend time in nature. I crochet, knit, lift weights, attend dance classes, and go on long walks.
            I have always been drawn to volunteering and working together with others. In my teens I worked at many anime conventions, doing stuff like website tranlation, managing the cleaning crew and café businesses, and ticket sales. 
            I also took part in arranging a convention in my hometown, which we grew from 80 attendees to over 250 in just three years.
            This involved writing applications for grants, booking premises and bands, accomodating for guest speakers, logo designing, promotional visits to other conventions, ordering merch, handling the 
            economics, and much much more. Apart from being a lot of fun, it taught me much about organization and planning.

          <h3>The KTH Electrum Library</h3>
          <p>
            Besides my studies I have worked in the KTH Electrum library as a student librarian secretary for many years. 
            It is a job which requires the ability to find information independently, solve problems in many different areas, be approachable to patrons, and memorize how to use systems.
          </p>
        
          <h3>Customer support and platform assistant at SJ</h3>
            <p>            
              I worked for two summers (and part-time in-between) at the ticket sales office for the railway company SJ in the Stockholm Central Station. 
              The job consisted of many tasks requiring the ability to take responsibility, fast thinking, and being prepared for anything. 
              Work tasks included manning info desks and cashiers, managing delays and reimburshments, and providing information to travelers in and around the station. 
              I got to practice a lot how to communicate with customers and how to handle emergencies gracefully.
            </p>

          <h3>Teaching assistant KTH</h3>
            <p>            
              I worked as a teachers assistant for the course Human Perception for Information Technology in the autumn of 2021. 
              I graded assignments and assisted with the final presentation event of the course. 
            </p>

          <h3>Student Chapter</h3>
          <p>
            During my time at KTH I have been very active in the student chapter IN-Sektionen. I have lead event organization groups, held responsibility over equality and safety work, and much more.
            These sort of organizational positions helped me practice both teamwork and time management.
