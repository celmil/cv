            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to my website! My name is Celine and I am a fresh graduate from the master's program Interactive Media Technology at The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. 
              This website is where I store my CV and portfolio, and a bit about who I am and what I'm all about!<br>
              I continuously update this website with new info (or just to play around with the code), and you can find the code I wrote for this website in <a href="https://github.com/celmil/cv" target="_blank">this Github repository</a>.

          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            The traits what I value the most in myself are compassion, intelligence, and a sense of humor. 
            These work in my favour during group projects, and I have found myself to have a great ability to assume the role a group needs.
            While staying professional is important, I find that humor is a great way to nourish creativity and team bonding.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a proud Jill of all trades I love to learn, so during my university studies I took the opportunity to take as many varied courses as I could. I thrive off of structure, and you will rarely find me without my weekly planner by my side. 
          </p>

          <h3>My professional/academic interests</h3>
          <p>
            My interests revolve around Human-Computer Interactions, especially Physical interactions. 
            Sustainability and ethics are important topics to me, and my dream occupation would allow me to improve the lives of others through creative and ethical innovations in HCI.

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            In my spare time I like to do various handcrafts, stay active, and spend time in nature. I crochet, knit, lift weights, attend dance classes, and go on long walks.
            I have always been drawn to volunteering and working together with others. In my teens I volunteered at and arranged anime/pop-culture conventions, doing stuff like website translation, managing the cleaning crew and café businesses, and ticket sales. 
            Apart from being a lot of fun, it taught me much about organization and planning.
